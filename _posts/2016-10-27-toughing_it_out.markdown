Once again we reach a point where I’m finishing up an assessment and working on the final touches such as recording or encoding videos, minor clean up and handling any last minute issues that come up. This assessment, this whole module really was one of the toughest for me and I’m not sure why. I spent so much time in rails and on my final project there I can only assume I burned myself out and had to take a break. The downside to that is I couldn’t ever pick it back up and get going again.

I’m not lifting myself up or anything, but my path from no knowledge of ruby into sinatra and finally finishing with rails and my rails assessment took me a little over three months. I felt I was doing really well. That being said though, it took me two months to get through javascript. Just javascript, nothing fancy. It’s really hard to sit through the lessons and content when you just have no motivation. The last two months were rough, but here we are! Finally ready to submit my Rails with jQuery assessment and get started in Angular.

I’m excited to see what a real big library like Angular can do with javascript. I rallied against javascript so much that most of it didn’t really sink in until my assessment where I was a googling machine trying to find out how to do things, what code I needed to use to change values and so on and so forth. I really started to see the use and fun javascript could be … if you were writing it from scratch. Rebuilding my entire rails project to better fit with jQuery, not so much.

It’s not that rebuilding the app in general was hard (Ok, well it was gonna be a little hard) it was mostly that when I did my rails assessment I bit off WAY more than I could chew with this rebuild of a content management system that we use at my current employer. In for a penny, in for a pound I guess. Something a little simpler like a blog, or music library app might not have taken quite so much to re-engineer and rebuild for jQuery. The idea of a whole one page system that loads the information and moves without reloading was super enticing, but in the end a little bit too much for me to work with right now.

So here we go, submitting our project and moving on to Angular!  Yay!
