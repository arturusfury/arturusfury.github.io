Why software design?

It’s not the first time I’ve heard this question. I’ve had long talks with my wife, co-workers and family and in the end it was hard to describe what I was feeling or thinking.

I’ve always had a small place in my heart for programming. I used to love messing around with old MUD codebases when I was younger. Between that and doing what almost every nerdy little boy does and building little websites in HTML it was always a huge hobby for me. The only downside was that I couldn’t find a way to make that a career at the time. Continuing on with school eventually led me into a Network Administration program offered as a tech elective. While there were several courses on programming and web design which I took because they looked fun, I still didn’t have the vision or foresight to see either one of those as my career.

Year’s later I have been doing Network Administration for almost 10 years at my current employer and while I enjoy the work most days, new management has caused the environment to become toxic and negative. A few friends and two cousins who are all happily employed in the programming industry made me seriously think about turning my hobby, which I had been keeping up with a little bit at a time, into a career instead.

One friend, a recent graduate of the Turing program out in Denver, has really helped me to realize that with some of these programs it could really be an option. Coming from a background in Radio he dropped everything to learn programming without any prior knowledge and is now a successful backend developer. So why not try?

That long winded explanation of my choices thus far leads us back to the original question, Why software design? I really think the best answer that I can give to everyone is why not? If this is something that I have always enjoyed as a hobby, why shouldn’t I try and pursue it as a career? The worst that could happen at this point is I attend a program like Flatiron or Turing and graduate and then it doesn’t work out. I can always go back to doing Network Administration somewhere, but with the way tech culture has exploded in the last ten years and since it doesn’t look like it’s going to slowing down anytime soon I felt like it was like the perfect time to take the leap.
