Recent discussions with a few people got me thinking about productivity and personal preference. When I first started working to learn programming I was using the default OS X terminal, basic Atom settings and my own ignorance of the way things should be. Now after countless hours of tweaking and searching online I have started to see how much more efficient my work can be. All it takes is a few steps and someone to show me where to start. So here I am hoping that I can show even just one person where to start and get their mind thinking, "Maybe I can change this here".


**Terminal**

The OS X terminal in my opinion will be the second or third most important thing you'll use to program. I never really thought about how to customize it or even if I should. For me a terminal and bash prompt has always just been whatever I was given and I used it to the best of my ability. Diving into it deeper now I realize that I can do so much more with it.  Simple little changes like adding a clock and my git branch started to make life so much easier when moving around and cloning, adding and committing things. I took that and then decided I could take it even further and thus I ended up with something like this.

I know it doesn't seem like much, but for me it's perfect. I have a nice clean interface for my terminal prompt where I can quickly see the time, the entire directory structure of my current folder and even a nice highlight to show what my current folder is. Then on the right we have my git branch that's easily accessible and readable for me so I always know which branch I'm working on. I tried several different things like battery percentages and all sorts of little scripts, but most of them seemed to just detract from the nice clean look I was going for.

I have looked into other shells like zsh, but after messing around with them I found that I didn't like the way they moved and handled. I don't know what it was about it. I'm just happy with how my bash prompt turned out today. If anyone want's my .bash_profile information feel free to contact me about it, I will gladly share it.


**Atom** or **Sublime**

A good text editor has to be the most important tool for almost any programmer. While I do love a good clean terminal prompt, a text editor like Atom or Sublime can make your life SO much easier and you might not even know it!  Before I get too in-depth here I should say that I've chosen to use Atom over Sublime. Both are good options and I think they are accepted almost anywhere, however I just liked Atom better. Nothing bad about Sublime and you'll see it used in a lot of the example videos. Again it's all about personal preference and a lot of the times it comes down to which you were exposed to first.

Right out of the box these editor's give you so many nice tools due to the packages or plugins that they come with. Auto completion, auto closing tags, bracket matchers (because who hasn't spent hours finding a missing bracket), and so much more. However that's just the beginning. You can find user submitted packages out there to download that continue to make life easier. I've thrown together a list of some of my favorites.

* [auto-update-packages](https://atom.io/packages/auto-update-packages) While this plugin is simple it helps to make sure all the rest of your packages are up to date with the latest fixes and features. Sometimes a new feature will break things, however more often than not you're going to find it helpful.
* [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons) This simple little package just helps to make filetypes easier to identify when you are browsing the file tree. Clean, simple, elegant.
* [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) & [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) are two great plugins if you do anything in web design. Not only does it allow you to use a nifty little color popout to pick the color you want to use, it will also change the background behind that color text to give you a visual representation of every color code in your css or html file.
* [open-in-browser](https://atom.io/packages/open-in-browser) is a nice little plugin that makes previewing your html or css changes a little easier by giving you a quick right click menu option to open whatever page you right-clicked on in a web browser. Just a quick little time saver.
* [terminal-plus](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus) is another one of those time saver plugin's I like that means I don't need to leave my atom window to access the terminal. It even loads my custom bash prompt, yay!
* [git-plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus) is the last of the plugin's that I almost cannot live without anymore. Git Plus allows me to do so much with my git repos with a few simple clicks. I can add all, commit with a message and push all the files to my active branch with one click.  With this I'm doing commits more often so that I have a better record of all of my changes.


These things sometimes take some time to find the right packages or bash prompt settings that are going to make you happy, but in the long run little things like these help to speed up your programming and web design so much.
