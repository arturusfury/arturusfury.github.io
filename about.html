<p>My name is Brian and I started learning Full Stack Development with Flatiron on July 1st.  Currently I work as the only Central Office Technician at a small rural phone company.  My job is to ensure everyone get's dial tone and internet without any problems so they can do things like learn programming online whenever they want!</p>

<p>I've been happily married for a little under a year at this point and plan on buying a house soon to continue on my life adventure.</p>
